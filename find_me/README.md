## Prompt

It took some effort to hide this flag. Can you find it?

## Setup

First take a picture of something almost noticeable, then add gps metadata to the photo. Print off the flag and tape it at that location.

## Solving the Challenge

Using exiftool, we can see the geo-positional data of the image. Following that on google, we find Stocker Center. Finding the room number shown in the image will give us the flag.
