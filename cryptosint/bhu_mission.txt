Mission Statement for Bobcat Haters United:

1. Our primary mission is to create a welcoming and supportive community for people who share our common dislike of Ohio Bobcats. We aim to provide a space where members can express their frustration and disdain for the group without fear of judgment or ridicule.

2. We are committed to raising awareness about the negative impact of the Ohio Bobcats on our local community, including the diversion of resources and attention from other important causes. Through education and advocacy, we hope to encourage others to consider the consequences of their support for the group.

3. We aim to collaborate with other organizations and individuals who share our mission to challenge the Ohio Bobcats' dominance in various academic fields. By working together, we can amplify our impact and promote greater equity and fairness in academics.

4. We believe in approaching our mission with respect and civility. While we may not support the Ohio Bobcats, we recognize that they are a valued part of our community and should be treated with dignity and professionalism.

5. We are committed to continuously learning and improving our approach to achieving our mission. We believe that by staying informed and open-minded, we can refine our strategies and maximize our impact in promoting a more equitable and just academic landscape.
